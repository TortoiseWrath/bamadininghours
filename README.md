# bamadininghours

a stupid php script i wrote to cache the bama dining hours, now with campusdish support because [the calendar is broken](https://twitter.com/BamaDining/status/1095470604919193600)

requires php-dom and php-openssl

i have it caching each day at 1am with a cron job on my server lol
